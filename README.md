**Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio.**

I am **Otun Victor**, a data analyst with over four years of experience transforming raw information into clear, actionable insights that drive strategic business decisions. My work sits at the intersection of analytical rigor and visual storytelling — turning complex datasets into meaningful narratives that inspire better outcomes.

Over the years, I’ve developed a strong command of tools such as **Power BI, SQL, Excel, Python, Tableau, and R**, and I use them to explore, clean, and visualize data with precision and creativity. My experience spans several industries — from **fintech and e-commerce to healthcare and supply chain** — where I’ve helped organizations understand their numbers, measure performance, and identify opportunities for improvement.

This portfolio brings together some of the projects that reflect my analytical approach, technical depth, and problem-solving ability. Each project represents a different challenge — whether it’s optimizing payment processes for a fintech company, segmenting customers for an e-commerce brand, or analyzing health data to uncover risk patterns. Through these case studies, I aim to demonstrate not just how I handle data, but how I translate it into decisions that matter.

Beyond technical skills, I pride myself on critical thinking and clarity of communication. I believe the true value of a data analyst lies not only in analyzing figures but in helping people see the story those figures tell. My work is guided by curiosity — asking the right questions, validating assumptions, and ensuring that every insight is backed by evidence and context.

In this repository, you will find interactive dashboards built in Power BI, Tableau, and Excel; SQL and Python scripts used to prepare and analyze large datasets; and reports that bring data-driven insights to life in a concise and visually engaging way. Each project reflects my commitment to analytical accuracy, process efficiency, and clear presentation.

I see data analysis as a partnership between logic and creativity — one that helps organizations make informed, confident choices in an increasingly data-driven world.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. I hope you find it both insightful and inspiring, and I welcome any opportunity to connect, collaborate, or discuss how data can make a measurable difference.
